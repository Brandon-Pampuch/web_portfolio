## Mood Bloom
Mood Bloom was created to help patients using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to keep track of their mood data for visits with their therapists. It was designed as a PWA to better suit the needs of users on the run. Mood Bloom was a two month build that included a **MongoDB/GraphQL/Express/Passport** back-end and a **React/Apollo** front-end.

## Macrame
Macrame is now released and being used by several non-profits in Greece to allow refugees to share their stories anonymously without affecting their asylum status.  It was first built with **React/Redux** and then migrated to **Gatsby** to allow for better content management.  The hope is to hand the project off to refugees themselves. It was designed as a PWA for refugees to have better access, but also is fully responsive.
